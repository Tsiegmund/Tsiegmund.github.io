        Hi, i'm Tyler. My accomplishments are as follows: Firstly, I had helped work on an unfinished game called "Juice Games" with a few friends of mine. My role was to do programming for the game with someone else. Another accomplishment I have is a page similar to this one that I worked on last year. That one had a working random number generator that had been made in Javascript. I liked it because the code was similar to Python, which is something i'm familiar with. Finally, I did do some work at home to make a miniature game in command prompt called "CMD-RPG." It was very silly and primative and mostly only used for me to practice anything in Python, such as random damage values and random enemy types spawning. Still, it got semi-far. <br>
        <br>
        Next, my goals: My main goal in this industry is to make any kind of game, although I do have a few preferences. Such as either an RPG or a Roguelike. That's about all I want. Nothing too crazy <br>
        <br>
        Not sure which credentials I've gotten, besides things such as honor roll, or that I have badges from scouts. <br>
